# Elden-Ring-AHK
Autohotkey script for Elden Ring

Dedicated Run and Roll keys.
No delay roll (happens on key down).
Dedicated back-step that works while moving.
2-hand keys.
Quick pocket (all 6) and gesture keys.
Exit to Main Menu macro.
Many Quality-of-life features to reduce consolitis.

My key map:

Movement Control: LAlt
Movement:  WASD
Backstep Dodge Roll: P
Jump: Shift-Space
Crouch: LCTRL

Reset Camera/Lockon: X

Switch Sorcery: Up / Scroll up
Switch Item: Down / Scroll down
Switch Right-hand: Right
Switch Left-hand: Left

Attack: Lbutton
Strong Attack: Rbutton
Guard: Q
Skill: R
Use Item: Middle click
Event action: E

Mouse mapping (done through mouse software)
Scroll Left: Left arrow
Scroll Right: Right arrow
Back: Q
Forward: R
Side button: E
Top forward (2ndary fwd?): Z
Top back: X

I recommend not blocking the keyboard keys around WASD because of the menu functions.  You could do without ZXCV, but QERTYF are all needed.

Will this get me banned???
EAC has no history of banning autohotkey users.  Since AHK has so many legitimate uses, they cannot simply ban because it is running on your PC.
